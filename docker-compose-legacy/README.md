Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker defined using the Compose file format.  
A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up your application are configured ([overview](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)).

This package exists for legacy reasons and provides Docker Compose V1 (`docker-compose`).  
Compose V1 is officially [End of Life](https://github.com/docker/compose/tree/master#warning-compose-v1-is-deprecated-warning) and should be replaced with Compose V2 ([package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/docker-compose)).  
From the end of June 2023 Compose V1 wonâ€™t be supported anymore.
