Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. This package contains the docker client for Windows and not the Docker engine to run containers on Windows hosts.

NOTE: Docker client for Windows is not a Docker container engine for Windows. You can use this to manage your Linux and Windows machines running as Docker hosts. You might want to have a look at the "docker-desktop" package.
